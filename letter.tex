We are a small but diverse group of students who wish to convey an important message to the people making long-term decisions for Hamline University.
This message is not meant to be an attack on your previous guiding decisions.
In fact, we wish to congratulate your group effort in constructing an environment here at Hamline that has allowed us to succeed in our respective fields.
We all hold several identities, but for the purposes of this message, we wish to point out that we are not only scientists, but musicians, artists, and writers.
We, no matter our connection with the natural sciences, have all been impacted by the collaborative undergraduate research (CUR) program here at Hamline, and wish to see it encouraged to grow.

The CUR program is unlike any other research programs available to students of our level throughout the nation.
Research programs at other universities do exist; nevertheless, they are confined to the natural sciences and they do not offer the independence that truly allows the student to learn.
The CUR program supports both of these rare advancements in undergraduate education, which sets Hamline as a premier institution for students to \textbf{not only do research but to learn how to research}.
We fear that the uniqueness of the CUR program here at Hamline is unappreciated, and we wish to make a public statement in support of it.
